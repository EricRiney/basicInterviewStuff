**1. What is a potential pitfall with using typeof bar === "object" to determine if bar is an object? How can this pitfall be avoided?**

Although `typeof bar === "object"` is a reliable way of checking if `bar` is an object, the surprising gotcha in JavaScript is that `null` is also considered an object!

Therefore, the following code will, to the surprise of most developers, log `true` (not `false`) to the console:

`var bar = null;`
`console.log(typeof bar === "object");  // logs true!`
As long as one is aware of this, the problem can easily be avoided by also checking if bar is null:

`console.log((bar !== null) && (typeof bar === "object"));  // logs false`

**2. What is the significance of, and reason for, wrapping the entire content of a JavaScript source file in a function block?**

This is an increasingly common practice, employed by many popular JavaScript libraries (jQuery, Node.js, etc.). This technique creates a closure around the entire contents of the file which, perhaps most importantly, creates a private namespace and thereby helps avoid potential name clashes between different JavaScript modules and libraries.

Another feature of this technique is to allow for an easily referenceable (presumably shorter) alias for a global variable. This is often used, for example, in jQuery plugins. jQuery allows you to disable the `$` reference to the jQuery namespace, using `jQuery.noConflict()`. If this has been done, your code can still use `$` employing this closure technique, as follows:

`(function($) { /* jQuery plugin code referencing $ */ } )(jQuery);`

**3. What is the significance, and what are the benefits, of including 'use strict' at the beginning of a JavaScript source file?**

The short and most important answer here is that `use strict` is a way to voluntarily enforce stricter parsing and error handling on your JavaScript code at runtime. Code errors that would otherwise have been ignored or would have failed silently will now generate errors or throw exceptions. In general, it is a good practice.

Some of the key benefits of strict mode include:

* Makes debugging easier. Code errors that would otherwise have been ignored or would have failed silently will now generate errors or throw exceptions, alerting you sooner to problems in your code and directing you more quickly to their source.
* Prevents accidental globals. Without strict mode, assigning a value to an undeclared variable automatically creates a global variable with that name. This is one of the most common errors in JavaScript. In strict mode, attempting to do so throws an error.
* Eliminates `this` coercion. Without strict mode, a reference to a `this` value of null or undefined is automatically coerced to the global. This can cause many headfakes and pull-out-your-hair kind of bugs. In strict mode, referencing a `this` value of null or undefined throws an error.
* Disallows duplicate property names or parameter values. Strict mode throws an error when it detects a duplicate named property in an object (e.g., `var object = {foo: "bar", foo: "baz"};`) or a duplicate named argument for a function (e.g., `function foo(val1, val2, val1){}`), thereby catching what is almost certainly a bug in your code that you might otherwise have wasted lots of time tracking down.
* Makes `eval()` safer. There are some differences in the way `eval()` behaves in strict mode and in non-strict mode. Most significantly, in strict mode, variables and functions declared inside of an `eval()` statement are not created in the containing scope (they are created in the containing scope in non-strict mode, which can also be a common source of problems).
* Throws error on invalid usage of `delete`. The delete operator (used to remove properties from objects) cannot be used on non-configurable properties of the object. Non-strict code will fail silently when an attempt is made to `delete` a non-configurable property, whereas strict mode will throw an error in such a case.

**4. Consider the two functions below. Will they both return the same thing? Why or why not?**
`function foo1()
{
  return {
      bar: "hello"
  };
}

function foo2()
{
  return
  {
      bar: "hello"
  };
}`

Surprisingly, these two functions will not return the same thing. Rather:

`console.log("foo1 returns:");`
`console.log(foo1());`
`console.log("foo2 returns:");`
`console.log(foo2());`
will yield:

`foo1 returns:`
`Object {bar: "hello"}`
`foo2 returns:`
`undefined `
Not only is this surprising, but what makes this particularly gnarly is that foo2() `returns` undefined without any error being thrown.

The reason for this has to do with the fact that semicolons are technically optional in JavaScript (although omitting them is generally really bad form). As a result, when the line containing the return statement (with nothing else on the line) is encountered in foo2(), a semicolon is automatically inserted immediately after the return statement.

No error is thrown since the remainder of the code is perfectly valid, even though it doesnâ€™t ever get invoked or do anything (it is simply an unused code block that defines a property bar which is equal to the string "hello").

This behavior also argues for following the convention of placing an opening curly brace at the end of a line in JavaScript, rather than on the beginning of a new line. As shown here, this becomes more than just a stylistic preference in JavaScript.
