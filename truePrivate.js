// What is the drawback of creating true private methods in JavaScript?

// One of the drawbacks of creating true private methods in JavaScript 
// is that they are very memory-inefficient, as a new copy of the 
// method would be created for each instance.

var Employee = function (name, company, salary) {
    this.name = name || "";       //Public attribute default value is null
    this.company = company || ""; //Public attribute default value is null
    this.salary = salary || 5000; //Public attribute default value is null

    // Private method
    var increaseSalary = function () {
        this.salary = this.salary + 1000;
    };

    // Public method
    this.dispalyIncreasedSalary = function() {
        increaseSlary();
        console.log(this.salary);
    };
};

// Create Employee class object
var emp1 = new Employee("John","Pluto",3000);
// Create Employee class object
var emp2 = new Employee("Merry","Pluto",2000);
// Create Employee class object
var emp3 = new Employee("Ren","Pluto",2500);
